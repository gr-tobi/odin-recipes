        <h3>Pho Soup to soothe the SEA Soul</h3>
        <p>You've heard of chicken soup to soothe the soul? Well for many in Asia, especially in Vietnam,
            Pho is the soup of choice. The broth is light and flavorful, and the cuts of meat can be as varied or simple
            as you'd like. There is nothing more comforting than a nice bowl of pho, no matter the weather... and especially
            after a night of drinking. The following recipe will serve about three (3) people.
